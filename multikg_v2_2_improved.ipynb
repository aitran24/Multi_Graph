    "## ❌ T1003.001 Empty Graph - Root Cause Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem:\n",
    "T1003.001 graph has **0 nodes** after processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Root Cause:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"start_time\": \"2022-08-31T19:18:43.164692Z\",\n",
    "  \"end_time\": \"2022-08-31T19:18:56.408374Z\"  // Only 13 seconds!\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The metadata.json specifies a **13-second time window**. The temporal filtering in our pipeline removes all Sysmon events outside this narrow window.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Happens:\n",
    "- Sysmon events are logged with slight time delays\n",
    "- The procdump attack likely generated events before/after the metadata window\n",
    "- Most process creation events occur slightly outside the recorded attack window\n",
    "- Our strict temporal filtering (designed to reduce noise) removes these events\n",
    "\n",
    "### Potential Solutions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Widen Time Window** (+/- 30 seconds):\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # In process_technique_v2_2():\n",
    "   if start_time:\n",
    "       start_time_dt = datetime.fromisoformat(start_time.replace('Z', '+00:00'))\n",
    "       start_time_dt -= timedelta(seconds=30)  # Add buffer\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Disable Temporal Filtering for T1003.001**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   if technique_id == 'T1003.001':\n",
    "       start_time = None  # Disable temporal filter\n",
    "       end_time = None\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use process_list.json Instead**:\n",
    "   - Extract PIDs from process_list.json\n",
    "   - Filter by malicious process ancestry instead of time\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommended: Option 2 (Disable Temporal Filter)\n",
    "T1003.001 is a quick, focused attack (LSASS dump) - we can trust the config-based detection without needing strict temporal boundaries."
